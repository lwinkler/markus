Known problems
==============
- **Module UsbCam**: There is a crash if we reset this module through a command while using the GUI. This happens because the module is reseted while the Capture thread has not finished


Improvements
============
- It would be nice to have a flexible number of inputs for some modules. This could either means connecting multiple inputs on one slot or creating inputs dynamically.
