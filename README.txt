Markus:
=======

Markus is a program to create video detection applications. Its base philosophy is that an application can be separated into a set of simple modules. 

Each module implements a simple function (pattern detection, object tracking, background subtraction ...).


To run:
-------

run with the default configuration as defined by config.xml:

./markus 

or run any example application present in the project/ folder:

e.g. : ./markus project/FourCascades.xml
